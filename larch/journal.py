class Journal(object):

    '''A journal layer on top of a virtual filesystem.
    
    The journal solves the problem of updating on-disk data structures
    atomically. Changes are first written to a journal, and then moved
    from there to the real location. If the program or system crashes,
    the changes can be completed later on, or rolled back, depending
    on what's needed for consistency.
