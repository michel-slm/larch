NEWS for btree
==============

These are the release notes for btree, a Python implementation of a
copy-on-write tree, designed by Odah Rodeh.


Version 0.9, released 2010-05-26
--------------------------------

* Several speed optimizations.
* One of this requires a Least-Recently-Used cache, which is provided by
  my python-lru package. That is now a dependency.
* NodeStoreDisk now has an upload queue. This is so that when a node gets
  immediately overwritten, it can be removed from the queue, i.e.,
  removed before it gets encoded and written at all. This provides quite
  significant speedups.
* A bug fix for reference counting of index node is fixed. This allows
  the speedups from the upload queue to actually occur.
* On-disk node encodings have changed. Anything written by previous
  versions is now unusable.
